# Yelay Action Provider

This directory contains the **YelayActionProvider** implementation, which provides actions to interact with **Yelay Vaults** on EVM-compatible networks. More info can be found [here](https://v3sdk.yelay.io/).

## Actions

- `get_vaults`: Get the list of available Yelay Vaults with their current APY and addresses

  - Returns a formatted list of all available Yelay Vaults with their APY and contract addresses
  - Example:
    ```typescript
    const vaults = await provider.getVaults();
    /* Returns:
    Base WETH Vault:
      Address: 0x1234...
      APY: 3.4%
    ----------------
    Base USDC Vault:
      Address: 0x5678...
      APY: 5.2%
    */
    ```

- `deposit`: Deposit assets into a Yelay Vault

  - Deposits the specified amount of assets into the target vault
  - Example:
    ```typescript
    const result = await provider.deposit(walletProvider, {
      assets: "1.0",
      vaultAddress: "0x1234...",
    });
    ```

- `redeem`: Redeem assets from a Yelay Vault

  - Redeems the specified amount of assets from the target vault
  - Example:
    ```typescript
    const result = await provider.redeem(walletProvider, {
      assets: "1.0",
      vaultAddress: "0x1234...",
    });
    ```

- `claim`: Claim yield from a Yelay Vault

  - Claims accumulated yield from the specified vault
  - Example:
    ```typescript
    const result = await provider.claim(walletProvider, {
      vaultAddress: "0x1234...",
    });
    ```

- `get_balance`: Get user's balance and yield information from a Yelay Vault
  - Retrieves the user's balance and yield share information for a specific vault
  - Example:
    ```typescript
    const result = await provider.getBalance(walletProvider, {
      vaultAddress: "0x1234...",
    });
    // Returns: "Your balance: 1.5 ETH\nTotal yield shares: 0.2 ETH\nClaimed yield: 0.1 ETH"
    ```

## Adding New Actions

To add new Yelay actions:

1. Define your action schema in `schemas.ts`. See [Defining the input schema](https://github.com/coinbase/agentkit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING-TYPESCRIPT.md#defining-the-input-schema) for more information.
2. Implement the action in `yelayActionProvider.ts`
3. Add tests in `yelayActionProvider.test.ts`

## Network Support

The Yelay provider supports the following EVM networks:

- Base Mainnet (chainId: 8453)
- Ethereum Mainnet (chainId: 1)
- Sonic (chainId: 146)
- Arbitrum (chainId: 42161)
- Avalanche (chainId: 43114)

## Notes

- All amounts should be provided in whole units (e.g., "1.0" for 1 token)
- The provider handles conversion to atomic units internally
- The provider includes built-in error handling and user-friendly messages
- When using `get_vaults`, the returned vault addresses can be used directly with other actions like `deposit`, `redeem`, `claim`, and `get_balance`
